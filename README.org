** Compiling
- Navigate to the root folder of the project.
- Run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cargo build --release
#+END_SRC
- The =--release= flag is necessary, otherwise the performance will be very bad.
- Optional:
  - You can add the following into the =Cargo.toml= file to get a little more performance:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  [profile.release]
  lto = true
  #+END_SRC
  - And then run the above command.
- There will be an executable =tcfinder= in =target/release/=.
