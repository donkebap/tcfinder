* TrueCrypt Volume Header Finder
[[https://travis-ci.org/donkebap/tcfinder.svg?branch=master]]

TODO

** Limitations
If your TrueCrypt container was created:
  - after version 5 which introduced XTS
  - with default settings:
    - Standard TrueCrypt Volume
    - Encryption Algorithm: AES
    - Hash Algorithm: RIPEMD-160
    - No Keyfiles
then this may find the sector of the Volume Header for you.

Currently, it will not search for the Backup Header.


** Compiling
- Navigate to the root folder of the project.
- Run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cargo build --release
#+END_SRC
- The =--release= flag is necessary, otherwise the performance will be very bad.
- Optional:
  - You can add the following into the =Cargo.toml= file to get a little more performance:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  [profile.release]
  lto = true
  #+END_SRC
  - And then run the above command.
- There will be an executable =tcfinder= in =target/release/=.
